Coded the full game of clue in java. Game includes rooms, weapons, artificial intelligence players, and movement logic. 
  Created an intuitive and appealing user interface for smooth, easy gameplay utilizing the javax.swing library
  Tested code utilizing the JUnit library’s unit testing framework and eclipse’s debugging software
  Collaborated using peer programming within an agile framework and using github to share code
  Run game by running clue.jar or by running the board class within src/clueGame/Board.java
  Tests can be found in src/tests

Additional Comments: the board class contains the main method for the game, so run the board class instead of the ClueGame class to run the game
